# Nut Allergen Detection

## 📖 Description
This repository contains models for evaluating the presence of **nut allergens** (in crushed form) in food products such as **wheat in powdered form**. The models are trained on a dataset of food product images and their corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of nut allergens.

### 📂 Datasets
We utilize two types of datasets for training and evaluation:

1. **Hyperspectral Images**  
   - Captured using a hyperspectral camera, which captures light in many different wavelengths.  
   - The dataset contains images of food products along with their corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of nut allergens.

2. **RGB Images**  
   - Captured using a standard RGB camera.  
   - The dataset contains images of food products along with their corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of nut allergens.
